        <p>Life in highschool was so dreamming. it lasted so short with the people i hangout with. it so fast that we have to walk our separate way because we have different goals</p>
        <p>but we still stay connected with each other everyday though online</p>
        <p>I studied in Life Highschool. i gain alot of memories , pain, happiness and expearience along the way.</p>
        <p>I wish i could start my highschool life again but i cant life goes on and you have to move on also.</p>

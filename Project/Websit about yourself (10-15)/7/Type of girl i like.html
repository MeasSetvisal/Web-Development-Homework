        <h1>Type of girl i like</h1>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>For start i respect all woman especially my mom i really respect her. </p>
        <p>First of all my idea girl is that she love me back...... you can't love someone who doesn't love you</p>
        <p>I love girls who are independent, like she's on her on wheel, she know what she's doing.</p>
        <p>since she know what she's doing, she would likely know how i feel before making her decission.</p>
        <p>I really like a supportive person, like you can be yourself and they would really support you for being that</p>
        <p>like they really respect you for who you are.</p>
        <p>For appearance i really like chubby girl, because we can enjoy food together since i love eating so much.</p>
